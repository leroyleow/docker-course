# What is YAML

YAML files are composed of a series of key-value pairs, with the keys represented by strings and the values represented by scalar values (such as strings or numbers) or nested data structures (such as lists or dictionaries). YAML uses indentation and white space to indicate the structure of the data, which makes it more readable and easy to edit when compared to other formats like JSON or XML.

YAML has a simple and consistent syntax, which makes it easy to learn and use. It is also commonly used in many popular technologies like Kubernetes, Ansible, and Docker Compose.

In kubernetes context, YAML is used to create and manage resources in a Kubernetes cluster, such as pods, services, and deployments, using the kubectl command-line tool, which reads and interprets the YAML files to create the corresponding resources in the cluster.
